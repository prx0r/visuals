## Candidate pilot

The smallest coherent calibration unit begins with **Kumārikākhaṇḍa, Chapter 1, “Śrīnātha's Inquiry”**. PDF page 17 contains Sanskrit verses 1–4 and PDF page 18 contains the aligned Dyczkowski translation; the following page pair continues the inquiry. This is appropriate for source/translation/commentary separation and blind–reveal evaluation.

## Ingestion decision: blocked pending a faithful Sanskrit representation

The English layer extracts cleanly. The Sanskrit PDF text layer is encoded through a legacy embedded font and extracts as glyph-code text rather than IAST or Unicode Devanāgarī. The available renderer produced a blank Sanskrit page, and installed OCR has no Sanskrit language model. Therefore V2 must not ingest the extracted glyph stream as a Sanskrit reading.

## Follow-up font diagnosis

The Chapter 1 Sanskrit page declares `TimesNewRomanPSMT`, with neither an embedded font program nor a Unicode map. Its extracted ASCII-like stream is consistent with a legacy Devanāgarī-font workflow, but it cannot safely be identified as standard Kruti Dev from this PDF alone. A generic Kruti Dev converter is therefore only a hypothesis and must not be applied corpus-wide without calibration against a known source reading.

The reliable recovery workflow is:

1. acquire the original font or authoring source from the editor/publisher and create a font-specific Unicode mapping;
2. validate that mapping on the printed Chapter 1 heading and a manually checked set of at least 50 grapheme clusters/verse lines;
3. retain raw glyph codes and page coordinates beside every transcoded reading;
4. route low-confidence lines to human review, never directly to morphology or alignment.

## Empirical decoder control

An offline standard Kruti Dev decoder was tested only on the heading stream. It produced `मन्थानभैतवतन्त्रे कुमारिकाखण्डे`; replacing one context-specific glyph interpretation produces the expected `मन्थानभैरवतन्त्रे कुमारिकाखण्डे`. A second heading control still fails under the generic decoder. Result: the stream is Kruti-like but the extracted PDF mapping is not standard Kruti Dev. The V2 legacy-font adapter now records this as a **blocked** decoder candidate until a control suite passes.

Permitted next paths, in order:

1. obtain the editor's Unicode/IAST electronic source or a source-authorized plain-text edition with the same reading;
2. install an approved Sanskrit OCR model and manually validate each passage against page images;
3. ingest the translation, notes, and page-level provenance as a calibration-only record while leaving `reading_id` absent—never pretending it aligns to a reconstructed Sanskrit text.

This protects V2 invariants: raw source remains immutable, every translation ultimately references an exact reading, and uncertainty is visible.
# Pilot-source decision update — 2026-07-23

The supplied *Manthanabhairavatantra, Kumārikākhaṇḍa* archive remains a
valuable calibration source for its English translation, notes, and commentary.
It is **not** selected for the first Sanskrit-reading vertical slice. In the
available PDF, the Sanskrit is encoded in an unembedded legacy glyph font:

* text extraction yields a non-Unicode glyph stream;
* PDF rasterisation produces a blank Sanskrit page, so Tesseract has no
  recoverable image to read;
* a generic Kruti-style converter can recover part of a title but fails known
  controls, so it cannot establish an auditable Sanskrit reading.

The source reading is consequently retained as `unrecoverable_legacy_encoding`,
not silently guessed or normalised. A font-specific mapping may be added later
only after it passes a documented controls corpus.

## Replacement first vertical-slice source

Use the supplied Dyczkowski volume *The Stanzas on Vibration: the
Spandakārikā with Four Commentaries* as the first fully auditable local pilot.
Its Appendix 3 contains extractable Roman transliteration. The opening stanza
is present as:

```text
Yasyonmesanimesabhyam jagatah pralayodayau /
Tam Sakticakravibhavaprabhavam Sankaram stumah // 1
```

The same volume supplies an explicit English rendering in its discussion of
Stanza One, as well as distinguishable brief and extended commentarial
material. The import must record the appendix transliteration as an
edition-derived source reading, retain the page number, and mark the
commercial PDF as locally supplied / not for redistribution. The two text
forms must never be conflated with the garbled Devanagari-like OCR on other
pages of that scan.

This is a calibration pilot, not a substitute for the planned
Manthānabhairava/Kubjikā pilot. It exercises the complete V2 evidence path
without falsely claiming recovery of the MBT Sanskrit.
