# THE VISION & NAVIGATION — start here (for any new agent)

*2026-08-12. The single entry point. It gives the VISION (what we're building and why), the LOGICAL
PROGRESSION (in what order the ideas unfold), and the NAVIGATION (where everything lives). Read this
first; it tells you which docs to open and in what order. `docs/INDEX.md` is the flat reference; this
is the map with a compass.*

---

## 1. THE VISION (one paragraph)

We are building a **computable scholarly tradition**: a single evidence graph over Sanskrit sources
(source → translation → decision → commentary → theme → claim → essay → pedagogy), where every layer
is machine-queryable, every claim resolves to its source, and any reader — scholar or beginner — can
enter at the depth they need. The IPVV (Abhinavagupta's Vivṛtivimarśinī) is the flagship; the
architecture is agnostic and generalizes to any text (Tantra now, then Yogic/Vedānta, Buddhism/Greek/
Nyāya later). **One trustworthy scholarly core, rendered as many media projections** (essays, shorts,
video, AI-teacher) — see Vision 09.

The two engines that make it real:
- **PUSHING** — mechanically hound a text with "why" to expose its deepest arguments (the discovery).
- **LOGICAL ARGUMENTS AS GOLD** — turn those penetrations into auditable, strength-graded
  truth-packets (the formalization), which essays cite and learning teaches.

## 2. THE LOGICAL PROGRESSION (the order of ideas)

Read these in order — each builds on the last:

```
STEP 1 — THE CORPUS (the substrate)
  49 IPVV passages, source + L2 + C1 + themes, published in Pāṭala.
  → docs/PHASE1_IPVV_CORPUS_PROCESS_NOTES.md + machinelearning/IPVV-STACK-INTEGRATION.md

STEP 2 — THE VERIFICATION FLOOR (make it trustworthy)
  /api/resolve + /api/verify/* — every claim resolves; nothing unanchored is served.
  → docs/INDEX.md (the map) + the API routes

STEP 2b — THE SCHOLARLY-EVIDENCE SUBSTRATE (the source-evidence layer, 2026-08-13)
  The published-scholar corpus (Sanderson/Ratié/Torella/Bäumer) is the scalable scholarly CORROBORATION
  oracle — no live reviewer needed for SCHOLARLY_CORROBORATED. But it only becomes usable once it is a
  provenance-addressable evidence corpus, not a folder of PDFs. `source-evidence/` builds the thin layer
  (Publication→Witness→StableSpan→SourceAssertion→CorroborationEvent) by REUSING mature tools (GROBID/Zotero/
  OpenAlex/OpenCitations/RO-Crate/ORKG/OpenReview); Pāṭala owns only the epistemic seam. This feeds the
  two-source-side architecture: primary text + published scholarship converge at Proposition ↔
  CorroborationEvent ↔ SourceAssertion. The evaluation plane (TantraFact/ArgumentBench/PāṭalaQA) sits OUTSIDE
  the graph and tests it.
  → source-evidence/ + source-evidence/docs/ + DEVPLAN S0

STEP 3 — THE HUB (organize by source)
  Every primary source tracks ALL its outputs (essays, arguments, pushing, learning).
  → machinelearning/COMPOUNDING_RESEARCH_SYSTEM.md + data/corpus/hub.ts

STEP 4 — PUSHING (the discovery engine)
  How to deep-dive a text mechanically. The question-DNA + the agent spec.
  → ../research-library/pushing/PUSHING_GUIDE.md + AUTONOMOUS_PUSHING_AGENT_SPEC.md
    + QUESTIONNAIRE_REAL_DNA.md

STEP 5 — COMPARATIVE (ask every text the same deep questions)
  The agnostic core + tradition modules → a cross-text comparative matrix.
  → ../research-library/pushing/SPEC_COMPARATIVE_PUSHING.md

STEP 6 — LOGICAL ARGUMENTS AS GOLD (the formalization)
  Penetrations → auditable, strength-graded truth-packets → essays.
  → machinelearning/SPEC_LOGICAL_ARGUMENTS_GOLD.md + SPEC_ARGUMENT_TRUTH_PACKET.md
  → (deepened) machinelearning/_ACTIVE/ARGUMENT-IR-VISION.md — the CP4 target: the
    philosophical IR (Commitment, derivational Proposition, ResearchQuestion, frame, alignment,
    regime), built gold-first so the ontology is forced by evidence, then evaluated multi-way
    (ASPIC / Nyāya / semantic / formal) under a profile.

STEP 7 — THE ML LAYER (make it learnable + verifiable)
  Benchmark → retrieval baselines → the THEMES experiment → vertical fidelity.
  → machinelearning/MLUSEINPATALA.md + DEVPLAN.md + SPEC_CONSOLIDATED_BUILD.md

STEP 8 — THE PRODUCT VISION (the multi-resolution endgame)
  ORIGINAL/READ/GUIDE/STUDY/CRITICAL — one graph, many projections.
  → machinelearning/VISION-COMPUTABLE-TRADITION.md + MLVISION.md

STEP 9 — THE MEDIA LAYER + CROSS-TRADITION ENGINE (Vision 09)
  The scholarly core rendered as shorts/video/essays/AI-teacher (Workengestation = written voice,
  Renderio = video), then reproduced across traditions (Tantra → Yogic → Vedānta → Greek) —
  same machinery, new content each time.
  → docs/vision/vision-09-media-and-cross-tradition.md
```

## 3. THE NAVIGATION (where everything lives)

| Home | What it holds | Canonical entry |
|---|---|---|
| **Pāṭala repo** (`/root/projects/patala`) | the site/app: data model, API, reader, MCP, ML strategy | `README.md` → `docs/INDEX.md` |
| **Sanskritree specs** (`.../_stack/ipvv/specs/`) | the scholarly factory specs + full onboarding | `THE_COMPANION.md` |
| **Research-library** (`/root/projects/research-library`) | the essays, the PUSHING method, the comparative work | `pushing/PUSHING_GUIDE.md` + the essays in `recognition/` |

**The docs every agent MUST read first (in order):**
1. **This file** (the vision + progression).
2. **`docs/INDEX.md`** (the flat canonical reference — the single source of truth per concern).
3. **`endgamebuild/INFRA-INVENTORY.md`** — **WHAT EXISTS / WHERE / DON'T REBUILD.** The consolidated
   map of all built infra (schemas, factory, ML engines, eval plane, external tools, Atlas, API).
   **Read this before writing code** — if it's listed, extend it, not rebuild it.
4. **`endgamebuild/PROGRESS.md`** — the one-page current state (proven / building / next milestones).
5. **`THE_COMPANION.md`** (sanskritree) — the full-system technical onboarding.

> **Then, to see the whole vision as one zoomable map:** `docs/vision/CORE-BIBLE.md` — one vision
> chunked into 6 layers (sentence → paragraph → derivation graph → checkpoints → domain lenses →
> specs/gold/data). Every vision doc is a zoom-level of that ONE core, not a separate product.

## 4. THE TWO TRACKS (context engineering)

There are two agents (see `machinelearning/DUAL_AGENT_TRACK.md` and the operational
`machinelearning/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md`), and they SHARE the vision context until the
specialization splits near the end:

```
SHARED CONTEXT (both agents, the foundation)
  This vision file · docs/INDEX.md · THE_COMPANION.md
  The corpus (PHASE1 notes) · the hub · the verification floor
     ↓  (the split point — after the substrate, the lanes diverge)
AGENT 1 — ML/RESEARCH                AGENT 2 — CORPUS COMPILER + INTEGRITY
  owns: MLUSEINPATALA, DEVPLAN,        owns: data/corpus, app, lib, pipeline,
  benchmark, retrieval, experiments,   the source→L0→proof floor, the RAW-L0 factory,
  vertical-fidelity, mllogical         the corpus state machine + versioned L0 + review engine,
                                        the Sanskrit substrate + scholarly specs
```

The shared context is everything up to STEP 3 (corpus + verification + hub). After that, each agent
goes deep on its own lane, meeting again at the comparative matrix + the argument truth-packet.

## 5. THE REVIEW CHECKLIST (what a new agent should verify)

- [ ] You can state the vision in one paragraph (§1).
- [ ] You know the 8-step progression and where each step lives (§2).
- [ ] You've read the 3 must-read docs (§3).
- [ ] You know which lane you're on (ML/research vs corpus-compiler + integrity) and what you own (§4 + DUAL_AGENT_TRACK.md).
- [ ] You know the current state (what's done vs pending) — see `docs/INDEX.md` + the audit.

lane.*
