# PĀṬALA VISION — CANONICAL REVIEW INDEX

*2026-08-14. THE machine-parseable review of every vision doc. Each entry follows ONE schema so an
agent can resolve any doc to: proper name · what it is · core contribution · layer · build status ·
related docs. This is the canonical "what does each vision doc actually say, and is it built" reference.
Every field is stable and queryable.*

---

## THE SCHEMA (every entry)

```yaml
doc:            # original path
name:           # proper / canonical name
summary:        # one line — what it actually decides
contribution:   # the 1-3 ideas that matter most
layer:          # Layer 00-12 (see docs/layers/) + category (A-H, see CATEGORIES.md)
status:         # BUILT | PARTIAL | ASPIRATIONAL | INDEX (describes existing state vs design)
related:        # docs it links to
```

**Layer key:** 00 Governance · 01 Ingestion · 02 Atlas · 03 Factory · 04 Evidence · 05 Research ·
06 Commentarial · 07 Verification · 08 Human Authority · 09 Organism · 10 Surfaces · 11 Org/Economics ·
12 Live System. **Status key:** `BUILT` = describes working machinery · `PARTIAL` = substrate built, feature pending ·
`ASPIRATIONAL` = design/strategy, not built · `INDEX` = an index/lens artifact (no new claims).

# THE PER-LAYER VISION SYNTHESIS (which docs build each layer)

> This is the operational view: **for each Layer, which vision docs specify it, and its overall vision.**

## Layer 00 — Governance
**Vision:** one constitution: the anti-theatre rule, the authority ladder, the operating axioms.
**Docs:** `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS-DOCTRINE.md`, `CORE-BIBLE.md` (checkpoint layer), `NORTHSTAR.md`.
**Built:** `theatre_check.py`, `CANONICAL-DAG.yaml`.

## Layer 01 — Ingestion
**Vision:** any source → canonical objects with provenance + license firewall.
**Docs:** `expansion/vision-11...corpus-manifest.md`, `atlas-engineering-blueprint.md` (ingest step).
**Built:** `ingestion/` (SourceAsserter, AtlasWriter, 8 adapters), R2 Bronze snapshots.

## Layer 02 — Atlas
**Vision:** the canonical research graph — textual transmission, identity distinction, reconciliation.
**Docs:** `vision-14`, `vision-15`, `source-resolver-design`, `atlas/technical-architecture-v1`,
`atlas-engineering-blueprint`, `atlas-cloudflare-edge-layer`, `atlas-performance`.
**Built:** Postgres 22-table schema, resolver, API, crosswalk, deterministic UUID. **PARTIAL** (read API/reconciliation pending).

## Layer 03 — Factory
**Vision:** the compiler SOURCE→C1→THEMES, plus corpus expansion (Śiva-before-Abhinava).
**Docs:** `endgame1`, `expansion/*` (corpus), `technical-architecture-v1` (factory plane).
**Built:** workers, `object_registry`, scheduler, DAG, event ledger. **PARTIAL** (ARGUMENT/SYNTHESIS/upper layers empty).

## Layer 04 — Evidence
**Vision:** the contracts + adapters + eval plane (reuse-first, Pāṭala owns the epistemic seam).
**Docs:** `functionality/README.md`, `source-evidence/docs/reuse-first-stack.md`, `external-tools.md`.
**Built:** contracts, 69 tools documented, eval plane. **BUILT.**

## Layer 05 — Research / Epistemic Core (MOAT)
**Vision:** propositions → arguments → cruxes → synthesis → essay/education; the ArgumentSynthesis convergence.
**Docs:** `globalgoal.md`, `agent1atlas.md`, `essayguide.md`, `education/*`.
**Built:** argument/crux/synthesis/essay/education compilers, golds. **PARTIAL** (ARGUMENT/SYNTHESIS 0 objects).

## Layer 06 — Commentarial Graph
**Vision:** papers → ScholarContributionPackets over the primary graph.
**Docs:** `06-commentarial-graph.md`, `commentarialgraph-research.md`, `externalpaper-research.md`.
**Built:** none (design only).

## Layer 07 — Verification
**Vision:** external methods test Pāṭala; the benchmark family (TantraFact/ArgumentBench/...).
**Docs:** `vision-06`, `08-verification-plane.md`, `peer-review-goat.md`.
**Built:** eval plane (Inspect), the 10 self-tests. **BUILT.**

## Layer 08 — Human Authority
**Vision:** scholars review/adjudicate/promote; the scholar workbench + the review engine.
**Docs:** `vision-06`, `vision-07`, `scholars/README.md`, `contracts_human_authority.py`, `review_engine.py`.
**Built:** ReviewEvent ledger + impact_report (the Vouch equivalent, done better). **PARTIAL** (workbench UI pending).

## Layer 09 — Organism
**Vision:** the human-understanding graph — consumers as probes; adaptive learning; the Q moat variable.
**Docs:** `vision-09`, `organism/*` (5 docs).
**Built:** none (design only).

## Layer 10 — Surfaces
**Vision:** one core, five permission-scoped surfaces; the sites + APIs + MCP.
**Docs:** `vision-12`, `vision-13`, `atlas/agent-optimization`, `ENDGAME_SITE_SPEC.md`, `05-app-api-sites.md`.
**Built:** `app/`, `mcp/`, `openpatala/`, Astro. **PARTIAL** (Scholar/Contributor/Reviewer surfaces pending).

## Layer 11 — Org & Economics
**Vision:** scholar credit + market entry + the funding window.
**Docs:** `vision-08`, `vision-10`, `economics/README.md`, `endgame4`, `endgame5year`, `positioningpartners`.
**Built:** documented strategy only. **ASPIRATIONAL.**

## Layer 12 — Live System
**Vision:** Pāṭala decides what matters; Hermes decides how; docs project from truth.
**Docs:** `12-live-system.md`, `hermes-execution.md`, `handover/hermes/*`, `coordinate-peer-review.md`.
**Built:** Tier-1 truth (object_registry, review_engine, event ledger). **PARTIAL** (the 7 pieces pending).

---

## HOW AN AGENT USES THIS

1. **Resolve a doc** → its `layer`, `status`, `contribution`, `related` from the tables above.
2. **Resolve a layer** → the per-layer synthesis section lists which docs build it + its overall vision.
3. **Decide build vs borrow** → cross-check `docs/process/RECONCILIATION.md` (built vs borrowed vs agentic)
   and `docs/process/external-tools.md` (the 69 tools).
4. **The status column is the honesty check** — `ASPIRATIONAL` means design, not built.

---

## THE ANTI-REDUNDANCY VERDICT (strict consolidation)

> The machine-verifiable rule (enforced by `docs/vision/check_manifest.py`): **no two vision docs may
> share a distinct role.** Every doc has ONE role, ONE accurate name, ONE real file.

**Consolidation findings (what stays, what's distinct):**

| Cluster | Finding | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **organism** | `consumerorganismtech` + `organism_meh` both survey Graphiti/pyBKT/pyKT/OATutor/OpenTutor/GRKT/GKT | **KEEP both** — engineering-blueprint vs learner-theory are distinct roles. But the shared tool-survey is REDUNDANT with `docs/process/external-tools.md` (canonical); the organism docs should reference it, not re-list it. |
| **education** | `EDUCATION_VISION` + `LEARNING_STRATEGY` + `PATALA-EDUCATION-SYNTHESIS` all mention knowledge-packet/prerequisite | **KEEP all 3** — canonical / content-strategy / teaching-engine are distinct. `PATALA-EDUCATION-SYNTHESIS` is THE canonical; the other two reference it. |
| **indices** | `CATEGORIES` + `INDEX` + `REVIEWS` + `VISION-MANIFEST` all describe the vision collection | **KEEP all 4** — distinct: taxonomy / narrative / agent-review / machine-registry. |
| **vision-11** | flat `vision-11-siva-before-abhinava.md` was an EXACT duplicate of `expansion/vision-11...` | **REMOVED** (deduplicated; canonical = `expansion/`). |

**The strict rule going forward:** if a new vision doc claims a role already in the manifest, it must be
consolidated into the existing doc (or the existing doc split). Run `python3 docs/vision/check_manifest.py`
to verify no drift.

*This index is the canonical, agent-resolvable view of the vision. `CATEGORIES.md` is the category taxonomy;
`CORE-BIBLE.md` is the one-vision map; `INDEX.md` is the fuller narrative reference.*
