# PĀṬALA — DOCS INDEX (the single source of truth)

*2026-08-12. The one place to find the CURRENT authoritative document for each concern. The repo
accumulated overlapping handovers and specs; this index names the canonical one per topic and flags
stale ones as `[ARCHIVED]` so a new agent is never confused. If it's not here, it's not canonical.*

---

## How to read this

- **CANONICAL** = the one to read/trust for that concern.
- **[ARCHIVED]** = superseded; kept for history only, do not follow.
- The project has two sibling knowledge homes, by design:
  - **This repo (`/root/projects/patala`)** — the site/app: data model, API, reader, MCP, ML strategy.
  - **Sanskritree** (`/mnt/HC_Volume_106427611/sanskritree/translations/_stack/ipvv/specs/`) — the
    scholarly factory specs + `THE_COMPANION.md` (the full-system onboarding).

## The audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-12.md` — the full repo health audit + the organization plan (this is the
  current "where are we" record).

---

## Update protocol

When you add a doc that becomes the authority for a topic, **add it to this index and archive the
old one**. The index is the single gate for "what is current."
