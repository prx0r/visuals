# Pāṭala — Agent Reference & Navigation Map

*Compiled 2026-08-10 after a full read-through of the repo. Use this to navigate fast and to know what's actually next. The governing principle everywhere: **API/MCP first, UI last** — "no endpoint, no feature." Nothing is "done" until the API serves it. Do NOT overengineer: the API/MCP is a loose surface that grows as we build useful things, not a rigid pre-spec.*

## 0. One-paragraph orientation

Pāṭala (was `essays-tantrafiles`, at `/root/projects/patala`) is the **Tantra Hub** — a scholarly *authority/provenance/expert-validation* layer between manuscript repositories and AI. It is NOT a translation dump, an OCR engine, or a scan archive (those layers have incumbents: Gyan Bharatam, Muktabodha, OCHS, GRETIL). The moat = the **verified graph**: identity, provenance, expert disagreement, human-validation signals, relationships. Core invariant: **"AI proposes ≠ Pāṭala asserts"** — only human review creates accepted knowledge. The source corpus lives in `/root/projects/sanskritree` (= `/mnt/HC_Volume_106427611/sanskritree`, same path via symlink).

## 2. What's actually built (validated, per CHECKPOINTS)

1. AI-readable bibliography served by `/api/texts` + `/api/texts/:id` (69 records, URNs, tiers, statusChecked)
2. Full-depth bibliography for all schools (69 = 11 audited Trika + 58 seed, verified:false)
3. Corpus manifest: `/api/works`, `/api/relations/:work_id`, `/api/passages/:id`, `/api/search/passages`
4. Translation contract + MCP v1 + proof chapter (Kramasadbhāva 1.8–1.12)
5. Our T1 corpus ingested (4,016 passages) + `/api/texts/:id/translations` (working T1s)
6. OCHS manuscript witnesses (1,542 records, resolved to 18 works) + `/api/manuscripts`, `/api/works/:id/manuscripts`
7. Northstar alignment: `/api/context/passages/:id` (evidence bundle), `/api/terms/:lemma/senses` + `/occurrences`, `POST /api/resolve/work` (machine_proposed)
8. Discoverability: `/api` index, `/api/stats`, `/api/terms`, `/api/term-proposals`
9. The 6 formal primitives: `/api/assertions`, `/api/crosswalks`, `/api/stats.primitives`; `Rights` matrix
9b. Raw-corpus concordance: `/api/concordance` + MCP `concordance` tool

**MCP tools (12):** `get_work` · `get_source_passage` · `search_passages` · `get_related_works` · `get_term_senses` · `search_surface_occurrences` (honest: substring/lemmatized:false) · `get_working_translations` · `get_manuscripts` · `get_existing_translations` · `get_passage_context` · `find_term_occurrences` · `concordance`.

## 3. The current gaps / honest caveats (from PROCESS_NOTES + my read)

- **The MCP has never been wired into a real client session** to run a full translation end-to-end. The tools work (stdio-tested); the contract exists; but no model has yet translated a passage *through the loop with the skill injected*. **This is THE missing milestone.**
- Passage corpus = 5 works only. Many translated T2/T3s + untranslated sources (Devīpañcaśataka, Kramastotra, Mahānayaprakāśa) not yet segmented.
- 58 seed records `verified:false` (full-depth shape but not gold-audited).
- Per-entity routes (`/traditions/[slug]`, `/texts/[slug]`, `/concepts/[slug]`, `/people/[slug]`) are empty scaffolds.
- `data/atlas/concepts.ts`/`people.ts`/`texts.ts` may not include the newest T3'd texts' dossiers (sync-gap per SITE_STATUS §4).
- `globals.css` is NOT imported in `layout.tsx`; Tailwind v4 has no `@theme` block → utility colors like `text-ivory` don't exist (use `text-[color:var(--bone)]`).
- NOT deployed (invalid Cloudflare token); local `npm run dev`/`build` only.
- `data/occurrences.json` (the coarse precomputed per-lemma index from `TRANSLATION_SKILL_SPEC.md`) — I did NOT find this file; it's a listed v1 deliverable that may be missing.

---

## 4. What's next — in the RIGHT order (priority)

### THE milestone: the closed-loop translation proof (real MCP client)
Wire a real agent (Hermes/opencode/Claude/ChatGPT) to the Pāṭala MCP and translate a passage with the skill injected — the thing that proves the whole stack. Per NORTHSTAR, name it **"closed-loop evidence-bearing translation and review,"** not "connect MCP."
- Run `translate` on one clean chapter (candidates: Timirodghāṭana, or a Kulasāra paṭala — both genuinely-untranslated, in the working corpus).
- Confirm output has: stable passage IDs, `terms:` ledger, `reading:` (T3.1) beside the close draft, typed `[X]` flags, provenance header, `review_status: eligible_for_review`.
- Confirm a human can run R1→T2→R2→T3→T3.1→C1 on top without reformatting.
- Then record it as a Checkpoint. **This is the single most valuable next action.**

### Then (in order)
1. **Segment more of the corpus** — Devīpañcaśataka, Kramastotra, Mahānayaprakāśa (untranslated sources) and/or the T2/T3s. Grows the passage corpus the MCP serves.
2. **`/api/occurrences`** (term co-occurrence in context) — cheap over the 4k-passage corpus.
3. **The 25-verse closed-loop proof at scale** (the NORTHSTAR 3-month milestone) — 25 contiguous Kramasadbhāva verses.
4. **Build `data/occurrences.json`** if missing (the coarse per-lemma index).
5. **The review/decision graph** — scholar identities + review events (the first step up the moat stack; the primitives exist, need the workflow on top).
6. ~~**Resources endpoint** (`/api/resources` from `RESOURCES_SEED.md`) — typed, tradition-tagged, tiered objects~~ **DONE** — the register is `data/atlas/resources.ts` + `/resources` page + `GET /api/resources` (type/tradition/access/essential/status filters).

### Deferred (don't build yet — avoid overengineering)
- Full-text/vector concordance (concordance.py grep-based is fine now).
- Automatic parallel detection (capture manually during translation, validate later).
- `audit_translation` as a real endpoint (v1 = the model following the audit checklist).
- TEI export, scholar-review UI, versioning DB, TTS endpoint, manuscript ML resolver, benchmark.

## 5. Quick wins (low-effort, high-value, safe)

1. **Wire a real MCP client and run ONE chapter through the loop.** Highest value / highest leverage. Everything else is secondary until this proves the stack.
2. **Create `data/occurrences.json`** (grep the corpus once → per-lemma coarse `{work, range}`) — it's a listed v1 deliverable that appears missing, and it unblocks `find_lemma_occurrences` honesty.
3. **Sync the newest T3'd texts + 24 dossiers into `data/atlas/`** — the SITE_STATUS sync-gap (Jñānakārikā, Ajaḍapramātṛsiddhi, Kaularahasya, Kulapradīpa, Kubjikātantra, Śivasūtra, + the dossier lemmas already partially in `relations.ts`). Data-is-king; components are dumb.
4. **Segment Devīpañcaśataka / Kramastotra / Mahānayaprakāśa** into the passage corpus (they're the Kramasadbhāva neighborhood — the anchor set the translation loop needs).
5. **Fix the site housekeeping:** import `globals.css` in `layout.tsx` (or add a Tailwind `@theme` block) so utility colors work; fill the empty `[slug]` route scaffolds with minimal renderers reading `data/atlas/`.
6. ~~**Add `/api/resources`**~~ **DONE** (`data/atlas/resources.ts`, `/resources`, `GET /api/resources`). Next: surface resources contextually on text pages (the `works?` join layer on each resource) and add an MCP tool (`get_resources`).

---

## 6. Fresh-eyes observations (things possibly being missed)

- **The closed loop is the linchpin and it's not yet run.** All the infrastructure (MCP, schema, proof-chapter, 4k passages) is built but the actual *agent-in-the-loop* test is the one thing that validates it. It's explicitly the #1 next step in both HANDOVERs and PROCESS_NOTES — don't get distracted by adding endpoints/features until it's done.
- **The `data/occurrences.json` deliverable may be missing** (spec'd in `TRANSLATION_SKILL_SPEC.md` §3, never validated in CHECKPOINTS). Easy to add, unblocks honest lemma context.
- **Concordance performance**: `concordance.py` reloads a ~132MB index per request (noted in CHECKPOINT 9b). Fine locally; will need server-side caching before any deployment. Flag for later, not now.
- **Right-alignment risk**: the bibliographic `texts`/`works` and the atlas `texts.ts`/`relations.ts` are separate structures. `works.ts` derives from the bibliography; the atlas graph is separate. Keep them consistent when adding a text (the sync-discipline in SITE_STATUS is the guardrail).
- **Deployment blocker is only a token.** The code builds clean; a Cloudflare Pages token with `Pages: Edit` (or a git-connected project, as `tantrafiles-hub` does) is all that stands between this and live. Low effort to unblock when wanted.
- **Don't build the big layers** (parallel detection, audit engine, TTS, benchmark, manuscript ML) yet — the NORTHSTAR/NORTHSTAR-style guidance and PROCESS_NOTES both explicitly defer them. The MCP + closed loop + corpus density are the real path.

## 7. Build/verify commands

```bash
cd /root/projects/patala
npm run dev       # local dev (localhost:3000)
npm run build     # THE verification — must stay clean
node mcp/index.mjs  # MCP stdio server (needs the site running for API proxy)
```

Env for MCP: `TANTRA_API_BASE` (default `http://localhost:3000`), `TANTRA_CORPUS` (default `/mnt/HC_Volume_106427611/sanskritree/translations`), `TANTRA_CORPUS_ROOT` (concordance, default `/mnt/HC_Volume_106427611/sanskritree`).
