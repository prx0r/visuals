> **ARCHIVED / SUPERSEDED** — kept for history only. Do NOT follow as current. See `docs/INDEX.md` + `docs/DOCS-AUDIT.json` for the canonical doc for this concern.

Yes. I did a broad pass and there is enough material here to make the **Resources** section a serious product in its own right.

The key is not to make it a dumb links page. Give every resource a type:

`PRIMARY TEXT · MANUSCRIPT · TRANSLATION · SCHOLARSHIP · TRADITIONAL TEACHING · LECTURE · TOOL · LEGACY ARCHIVE`

and tag it by `Trika / Krama / Kubjikā / Kaula / Siddhānta / Śrīvidyā / Śākta / Pratyabhijñā / general`.

## 1. Muktabodha — absolutely foundational

**Muktabodha Digital Library**

[https://muktabodha.org/digital-library/](https://muktabodha.org/digital-library/)

New interface:

[https://muktabodha-digital-library.org/](https://muktabodha-digital-library.org/)

Legacy library:

[https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/digital_library](https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/digital_library)

This should probably be the **#1 external resource** on your entire site. It currently reports more than 3,000 digitally preserved texts, over 570 searchable e-texts, and more than 380 manuscript-derived tantric e-texts prepared under Mark Dyczkowski's supervision. It also incorporates more than 2,000 mostly Śaiva Siddhānta paper transcripts from IFP. ([Muktabodha][1])

They also now have their own translation programme:

[https://muktabodha.org/translation-series/](https://muktabodha.org/translation-series/)

They intend to publish translations of ten mainly untranslated KSTS works. ([Muktabodha][2])

# 2. GRETIL — machine-readable Sanskrit goldmine

[https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html)

Download catalogue:

[https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretilbk.htm](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretilbk.htm)

Śaiva UTF-8 collection:

[https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gret_utfbk.htm](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gret_utfbk.htm)

GRETIL already contains machine-readable texts including:

* Tantrāloka
* Tantrasāra
* Mālinīślokavārttika
* Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī
* Paramārthasāra + Yogarāja
* Kramastotra
* Bhairavastava
* Bodhapañcadaśikā
* many other philosophical sources. ([Gretil][3])

Example Tantrāloka:

[https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_abhinavagupta-tantrAloka.htm](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_abhinavagupta-tantrAloka.htm)

The Tantrāloka file even identifies its source edition and carries a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence. ([Gretil][4])

For our API this is enormously valuable because it is **text, not scanned pages**.

`PRIMARY TEXT / DOWNLOADABLE / MACHINE READABLE / ESSENTIAL`

# 3. Viśvāsa / Āgama collection

[https://vishvasa.github.io/AgamaH_shaivaH/](https://vishvasa.github.io/AgamaH_shaivaH/)

This thing is deceptively valuable. It mirrors/organizes huge quantities of Śaiva, Śākta, Muktabodha-derived and related material in browsable GitHub-hosted pages.

We've already found through it:

* Kulasāra
* Kālānalatantra
* Tārārahasya
* Cidgaganacandrikā
* Yogapīṭhakramodaya
* Śambhunirṇaya
* Kubjikā materials
* Śaiva Siddhānta materials
* Tantrāloka scholarship/source maps

It also has old translated material, e.g. Woodroffe's Mahānirvāṇatantra. ([Vishvas's Website][5])

This deserves first-class indexing, even though its UX is… eccentric.

# 4. Sanskrit Documents

Tantra:

[https://sanskritdocuments.org/iast/tantra/](https://sanskritdocuments.org/iast/tantra/)

Devanāgarī:

[https://sanskritdocuments.org/sanskrit/tantra/](https://sanskritdocuments.org/sanskrit/tantra/)

Devī/Śākta:

[https://sanskritdocuments.org/itrans/doc_devii.php](https://sanskritdocuments.org/itrans/doc_devii.php)

Scanned books:

[https://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/index.php](https://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/index.php)

This is considerably better than I remembered. The Tantra directory currently contains things like:

* Akulavīratantra
* Kulānandatantra
* Paraśurāmakalpasūtra
* Prapañcasāratantra
* Jñānasaṅkalinītantra
* Mātṛkācakraviveka

often with text **and scans**. ([Sanskrit Documents][6])

The Devī section itself points outward to a lot of old tantric web infrastructure, including Ambā and ShivaShakti. ([Sanskrit Documents][7])

Important rights note: SanskritDocuments explicitly asks that its volunteer-prepared files **not simply be reposted onto other sites without permission**. So index/deep-link by default rather than copying their content. ([Sanskrit Documents][6])

# 5. SARIT

[https://sarit.indology.info/apps/sarit-pm/docs/welcome.html](https://sarit.indology.info/apps/sarit-pm/docs/welcome.html)

This one is especially appealing for our API philosophy.

SARIT provides scholarly electronic editions with provenance/change history, full-text search and downloadable **XML, EPUB and PDF**, and says its texts are Creative Commons licensed. ([Sarit][8])

It isn't Tantra-specific, but where it overlaps our corpus it is extremely valuable.

# 6. OCHS Manuscript Database

Main database:

Śākta collection:

[https://ochs-database.netlify.app/sakta/](https://ochs-database.netlify.app/sakta/)

This deserves much more attention.

It provides manuscript-level metadata including:

* text title
* alternative titles
* language
* script
* physical location
* provenance
* external catalogue IDs
* whether photographs exist
* whether text is available
* approximate dates. ([ochs-database.netlify.app][9])

Perfect for our acquisition tracker.

# 7. IFP — French Institute of Pondicherry

Manuscripts:

Indology department:

Bookstore/publications:

[https://www.ifpindia.org/bookstore/](https://www.ifpindia.org/bookstore/)

This is **essential for Siddhānta**.

The collection contains roughly 8,500 palm-leaf codices, with about **1,900 codices classified as canonical Śaiva Tantra/Āgama** and another ~1,890 relating to mantra and ritual manuals. The collection is especially rich in Śaiva Siddhānta and is UNESCO Memory of the World material. ([French Institute of Pondicherry][10])

A lot of the critical editions we will reference originate from IFP/EFEO work.

`MANUSCRIPT / CRITICAL EDITIONS / SIDDHĀNTA / ESSENTIAL`

---

# 8. EFEO publications

[https://publications.efeo.fr/](https://publications.efeo.fr/)

Important because IFP/EFEO publications routinely contain **critical Sanskrit editions + translations of obscure tantric material**.

For example, *Temple Design in Six Early Śaiva Scriptures* critically edits and translates passages from:

* Bṛhatkālottara
* Devyāmata
* Kiraṇa
* Mohacūrottara
* Mayasaṃgraha
* Piṅgalāmata. ([École française d'Extrême-Orient][11])

So our bibliography crawler should search EFEO per text title.

Old NGMPP digital records:

This is where a lot of our:

Manuscript database:

[https://www.kaulastudies.org/manuscriptdatabase](https://www.kaulastudies.org/manuscriptdatabase)

This is basically a human collaborator waiting to happen.

Their stated workflow is exactly our upstream pipeline:

**identify → locate → secure permission → transcribe → digitise** rare Kaula manuscripts. ([Centre for Kaula Studies][12])

They're operating from Dyczkowski's former Varanasi home/archive. ([Centre for Kaula Studies][13])

# 11. Sanskrit & Trika Śaivism — Gabriel Pradīpaka

Main:

[https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/](https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/)

Scriptures:

[https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/en/scriptures/136](https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/en/scriptures/136)

Trika library:

[https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/en/scriptures-trika-scriptures/277](https://www.sanskrit-trikashaivism.com/en/scriptures-trika-scriptures/277)

This is **enormous** for accessible Trika translations.

Current scripture list includes:

* Paramārthasāra
* Mālinīvijayottaratantra
* Parāprāveśikā
* Parātriṃśikālaghuvṛtti
* Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa
* Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam + commentary
* Śivasūtras + Vimarśinī
* Spandakārikā
* Spandanirṇaya
* Tantrāloka
* Tantrālokaviveka
* Vijñānabhairava
* Tantrasāra
* Śivadṛṣṭi
* Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā
* Śivastotrāvalī. ([Sanskrit & Trika Shaivism][14])

This is a **translation resource**, but we should label translations as Gabriel Pradīpaka's rather than silently treating them as critical editions.

# 12. Mahānaya

Scriptures:

[https://mahanaya.org/en/scriptures/](https://mahanaya.org/en/scriptures/)

Study tools:

[https://mahanaya.org/en/study/](https://mahanaya.org/en/study/)

This may be the **best niche Krama site online**.

It currently has Sanskrit + translations for material including:

* Kramasadbhāva
* Kramastotra
* Kālikāstotra
* Mahānayaprakāśa
* Arṇasiṃha's Mahānayaprakāśa
* Mahārthamañjarī
* Vātūlanāthasūtra
* Chummāsaṃketaprakāśa
* Śivadṛṣṭi
* IPK + Vṛtti
* Śāktavijñāna
* lots of small obscure Krama/Trika works. ([Mahānaya][15])

Example Kramasadbhāva:

[https://mahanaya.org/en/scriptures/kramasadbhavah/](https://mahanaya.org/en/scriptures/kramasadbhavah/)

Example Kramastotra:

[https://mahanaya.org/en/scriptures/kramastotram/](https://mahanaya.org/en/scriptures/kramastotram/)

The latter even identifies its Sanskrit source in Tantrālokaviveka. ([Mahānaya][16])

Texts/downloads:

[https://shivashakti.com/texts](https://shivashakti.com/texts)

Bibliography:

[https://shivashakti.com/bibby](https://shivashakti.com/bibby)

This site is an absolute **legacy Tantra archaeological site** and should definitely be indexed.

It includes Mike Magee's:

* translations
* bibliographies
* essays
* old editions
* downloadable PDFs/PostScript
* Śiva Sūtra
* Netra Tantra chapters
* Jñānasaṅkalinī Tantra
* Devīrahasya digest
* Tantrarājatantra Sanskrit
* Yoginīhṛdaya material. ([Shiva Shakti][17])

Netra:

[https://shivashakti.com/netra](https://shivashakti.com/netra)

It contains Magee's English rendering of chapters 1 and 10. ([Shiva Shakti][18])

Bibliography:

[https://shivashakti.com/bibby](https://shivashakti.com/bibby)

The old bibliography is actually valuable because it records obscure Sanskrit/Hindi editions that are difficult to discover elsewhere. ([Shiva Shakti][19])

**Important:** ShivaShakti itself states that some downloadable material is **not public domain and copyright remains with authors/artists**. Index/link it; don't blindly ingest every PDF. ([Shiva Shakti][20])

`LEGACY / TRANSLATION / BIBLIOGRAPHY / NICHE GOLD`

# 14. Ambā / ambaa.org

[https://www.ambaa.org/](https://www.ambaa.org/)

Yes — **still alive**.

The landing page currently exposes:

* PDF Books
* Śrī Vaidyanātha Dīkṣitīyam
* Dharma
* image archive
* audio archive
* mailing-list archive. ([Ambaa][21])

SanskritDocuments still explicitly points people toward the Ambā collection for Devī/Tantra material. ([Sanskrit Documents][7])

This is exactly the kind of site your project should preserve through **metadata and deep links**, because search engines don't expose its contents particularly well.

# 15. Anuttara Trika Kula / Mark Dyczkowski

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/)

Library:

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/libraries-links/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/libraries-links/)

Tantrāloka courses:

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/tantraloka-chapters-detailed-course/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/tantraloka-chapters-detailed-course/)

Sources of Tantrāloka:

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/sources-of-tantraloka-on-kaula-tradition/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/sources-of-tantraloka-on-kaula-tradition/)

This is another **essential**, especially because it contains material that isn't represented properly in academic databases.

The site houses Dyczkowski's writings, Tantrāloka programme, lectures, Kubjikā material, and long-form teaching series. ([Anuttara Trikakula][22])

The Tantrāloka chapter courses can be enormous—Chapter 1 alone is described as about 90 hours, while Chapter 6 contains 39 lessons/~60 hours and includes Sanskrit + transliteration + English translation PDFs. ([Anuttara Trikakula][23])

And this page alone is an amazing resource:

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/sources-of-tantraloka-on-kaula-tradition/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/sources-of-tantraloka-on-kaula-tradition/)

because it explicitly addresses Abhinavagupta's Siddhānta, Bhairava, Krama and Trika/Kaula sources. ([Anuttara Trikakula][24])

# 16. Lakshmanjoo Academy

Courses:

[https://www.lakshmanjooacademy.org/online-courses](https://www.lakshmanjooacademy.org/online-courses)

Kashmir Śaivism:

[https://www.lakshmanjooacademy.org/kashmir-shaivism/](https://www.lakshmanjooacademy.org/kashmir-shaivism/)

This is crucial for the **living/oral interpretation layer**, not necessarily our critical-edition layer.

The Academy says it holds more than 470 hours of Lakshman Joo's recorded translations/commentaries, including material on:

* Parātriṃśikā Laghuvṛtti
* Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa
* Śivasūtravimarśinī
* Śivastotrāvalī
* Spandakārikā
* Spandasaṃdoha
* Tantrāloka
* Vātūlanāthasūtra
* Vijñānabhairava
* Paramārthasāra. ([Lakshmanjoo Academy][25])

Some of their courses are free/donation-based and use original recorded lectures. ([Lakshmanjoo Academy][26])

We should classify these as:

`TRADITIONAL COMMENTARY / ORAL TRANSMISSION / LECTURE`

rather than `peer-reviewed scholarship`.

---

# 17. Wisdomlib

[https://www.wisdomlib.org/](https://www.wisdomlib.org/)

This deserves indexing **per text**, not just as a generic link.

Example:

[https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/svacchanda-tantra-sanskrit](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/svacchanda-tantra-sanskrit)

Wisdomlib has verse-addressable Sanskrit for works such as Svacchandatantra. ([Wisdom Library][27])

Its biggest usefulness to us is:

* discover editions
* verse-level linking
* bibliography
* snippets from scholarship
* definitions that connect obscure texts and terms.

I would store it as:

`REFERENCE / DISCOVERY / TEXT READER`

not automatically as authoritative scholarship.

# 18. Alexis Sanderson's corpus

OCHS profile:

[https://ochs.org.uk/fellow/professor-alexis-g-j-s-sanderson/](https://ochs.org.uk/fellow/professor-alexis-g-j-s-sanderson/)

This is one of the **highest-value scholarly resource nodes** we can create.

His Academia page currently makes freely downloadable material available including:

* *The Śaiva Age*
* *The Śaiva Literature*
* *The Śaiva Exegesis of Kashmir*
* Śākta transformation material
* unpublished Mṛgendra yoga translation
* Buddhist/Śaiva interaction handouts. ([oxford.academia.edu][28])

Hamburg provides a cleaner bibliography and direct PDFs for many major papers. ([Tantric Studies][29])

I would give scholars their own profile pages:

```text
/scholars/alexis-sanderson

with every resource tagged to traditions/texts/concepts.

---

# 19. Hamburg Centre for Tantric Studies

[https://www.tantric-studies.uni-hamburg.de/](https://www.tantric-studies.uni-hamburg.de/)

This has:

* Brahmayāmala project
* Early Tantra research
* Tantrasadbhāva work
* scholar profiles
* editions/translations
* project pages.

For example, its Brahmayāmala project documents critically edited/translated chapters rather than giving the misleading impression that the entire work has an English translation.

`ACADEMIC PROJECT / TEXTUAL CRITICISM`

---

# 20. Internet Archive

[https://archive.org/](https://archive.org/)

This is **indispensable for old KSTS scans**.

Example Tantrāloka/Open Library record:

[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25900924M/The_Tantra_loka_of_Abhinava_Gupta](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25900924M/The_Tantra_loka_of_Abhinava_Gupta)

That record exposes PDF, plain text, EPUB and other versions of the 1918 Sanskrit KSTS edition and links to the underlying Internet Archive item. ([Open Library][30])

Search pattern:

[https://archive.org/search?query=%22Kashmir+Series+of+Texts+and+Studies%22](https://archive.org/search?query=%22Kashmir+Series+of+Texts+and+Studies%22)

We should automatically look here for every old publication.

`SCAN / PUBLIC DOMAIN / OLD EDITION`

---

# 21. Open Library

[https://openlibrary.org/](https://openlibrary.org/)

Excellent companion to Internet Archive because it often gives cleaner bibliographic identity:

```text
edition
year
publisher
series
IA item
```

Again, useful for KSTS.

`BIBLIOGRAPHY / SCAN DISCOVERY`

---

# 22. Academia.edu

[https://www.academia.edu/](https://www.academia.edu/)

Do **not** scrape/rehost indiscriminately.

But as a **resource locator**, it is enormously important for Tantra because scholars often upload papers, chapters and drafts that are hard to find through publisher websites.

We already saw Sanderson's account containing many downloadable papers. ([oxford.academia.edu][28])

Create author nodes for:

* Alexis Sanderson
* Isabelle Ratié
* Judit Törzsök
* Somadeva Vasudeva
* Dominic Goodall
* Diwakar Acharya
* Shaman Hatley
* Péter-Dániel Szántó
* Csaba Kiss
* Nina Mirnig
* Mark Dyczkowski
* Raffaele Torella
* Bettina Bäumer
* André Padoux

Then link individual papers.

`SCHOLARSHIP DISCOVERY`

# 23. Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat archive

[https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat)

We already discovered that this can hide **actual Sanskrit e-text attachments** which Google barely surfaces.

Ciñciṇīmatasārasamuccaya was one example.

So this gets:

`OBSCURE SCHOLARLY EXCHANGE / ACQUISITION DISCOVERY`

# 24. INDOLOGY mailing list

[https://list.indology.info/](https://list.indology.info/)

Archive:

[https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/](https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/)

Extremely useful for finding announcements like:

* newly digitized texts
* unpublished e-texts
* editions
* manuscript IDs
* scholars asking/sharing resources.

This is probably something our acquisition bot should search automatically.

`SCHOLARLY MAILING LIST / DISCOVERY`

---

# 25. Angkor Database

[https://angkordatabase.asia/](https://angkordatabase.asia/)

Not Tantra-specific, but surprisingly useful for publicly hosted classic scholarship.

Example Sanderson:

[https://angkordatabase.asia/publications/saivism-and-the-tantric-traditions](https://angkordatabase.asia/publications/saivism-and-the-tantric-traditions)

It hosts a PDF of Sanderson's foundational “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions.” ([Angkor Database][31])

`SCHOLARSHIP MIRROR / SOUTH & SOUTHEAST ASIA`

---

# 26. Shaivite.org

Manuscript Resource Centres:

[https://www.namami.gov.in/manuscript-resource-centres](https://www.namami.gov.in/manuscript-resource-centres)

Not a text reader, but useful when you're trying to answer:

> **Where the hell is this manuscript physically located?**

Its resource-centre directory confirms institutions such as IFP and describes their specialist holdings. ([Namami Gange][33])

`MANUSCRIPT LOCATOR`

---

# 28. IFP + Muktabodha paper transcripts

This deserves its **own resource entry**, separate from generic Muktabodha.

Muktabodha says the collaboration produced more than 2,000 mostly Śaiva Siddhānta texts, with over 1,100 transcript PDFs. ([Muktabodha][1])

That is a whole hidden corpus.

`SIDDHĀNTA TRANSCRIPT CORPUS`

---

# 29. SanskritDocuments' scanned-book index

Again, separate entry:

[https://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/index.php](https://sanskritdocuments.org/scannedbooks/index.php)

Because the index points outward to:

* Ambā
* Muktabodha
* Āgama collections
* old scanned libraries
* assorted private digitization projects. ([Sanskrit Documents][34])

This is basically a **directory of directories**.

---

# 30. ShivaShakti bibliography

I would treat this separately from the main ShivaShakti site:

[https://shivashakti.com/bibby](https://shivashakti.com/bibby)

Because this is exactly what **our own bibliography is superseding**.

It's old—2007—but contains obscure titles/editions such as Sanskrit/Hindi ritual and tantric publications that modern academic databases often don't surface cleanly. ([Shiva Shakti][19])

`LEGACY BIBLIOGRAPHY`

---

# 31. Mahānaya's study/dictionary tools

[https://mahanaya.org/en/study/](https://mahanaya.org/en/study/)

Mahānaya isn't merely translations. It exposes Sanskrit study functions including transliteration, declension, sandhi and tradition-specific material. ([Mahānaya][35])

This is useful inspiration for our own Sanskrit reader.

`TOOL / SANSKRIT`

---

# 32. Muktabodha's current digitization feed

Worth tracking their news rather than only the library:

[https://muktabodha.org/](https://muktabodha.org/)

They are actively adding new e-texts, including current IFP Śaiva Siddhānta transcription projects. ([Muktabodha][36])

Our site could automatically have:

> **Recently digitized tantric texts**

by watching Muktabodha + INDOLOGY.

---

# 33. Dyczkowski's Tantrāloka source lectures

Again, worth a distinct resource object:

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/sources-of-tantraloka-on-kaula-tradition/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/sources-of-tantraloka-on-kaula-tradition/)

It's almost exactly the sort of content our atlas needs: tracing Tantrāloka backward into Siddhānta, Bhairava, Krama and Trika/Kaula sources. ([Anuttara Trikakula][24])

---

# 34. Dyczkowski's “World of the Yoginīs”

[https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/the-world-of-the-yoginis/](https://www.anuttaratrikakula.org/the-world-of-the-yoginis/)

A 12-lecture/~19-hour series contextualizing Yoginī traditions across Bhairava, Kaula, Kubjikā, Kālī and Tripurā. ([Anuttara Trikakula][37])

Great example of a resource we'd attach simultaneously to:

```text
concept: yoginī
Kubjikā
Kaula
Kālīkula
Vidyāpīṭha
```

---

# 35. Lakshmanjoo original audio archive

Not just the Academy homepage.

Their corpus of recorded oral translations/commentaries reportedly exceeds **470 hours**. ([Lakshmanjoo Academy][25])

That deserves a data class:

```text
resource_type = scholar/traditional_audio_commentary
speaker = Swami Lakshman Joo
text = Vijñānabhairava
```

rather than disappearing into “Videos.”

---

## Legacy / archaeological leads worth investigating further

SanskritDocuments itself still points to an old ecosystem that includes Ambā, Kalyanamandira, Śākta/Daśamahāvidyā archives, pūjā collections and older Tantra mirrors. ([Sanskrit Documents][7])

I would **not automatically publish all of those yet** because several are old, move domains, contain duplicate material, or have unclear provenance. But they belong in an internal crawler queue.

That is a fourth status:

```text
PUBLIC
VERIFIED

DISCOVERY
needs individual review
```

}
```

Whereas:

```json
{
  "name": "IFP Manuscripts",
  "url": "https://ifpindia.org/resources/manuscripts/",
  "types": [
    "manuscript_catalogue",
    "primary_source"
  ],
  "traditions": [
    "Śaiva Siddhānta"
  ],
  "access": "mixed",
  "machine_readable": false,
  "can_rehost": false
}
```

And:

```json
{
  "name": "GRETIL",
  "types": [
    "electronic_text"
  ],
  "access": "free",
  "machine_readable": true,
  "license_per_item": true
}
```

## The Resources UI could then be fantastic

Instead of:

> Useful links

have:

```text
EXPLORE RESOURCES

[ Primary Texts ]
[ Translations ]
[ Manuscripts ]
[ Scholarship ]
[ Lectures ]
[ Traditional Teachings ]
[ Sanskrit Tools ]
[ Archives ]

FILTER
Tradition: Krama
Format: Translation
Access: Free

────────────────────────

Mahānaya
Scriptures · Sanskrit · English
★★★★★ especially useful for Krama

Kramasadbhāva →
Mahānayaprakāśa →
Kramastotra →

────────────────────────

Muktabodha
Primary-text repository

17 Krama-associated records →
3 manuscript transcriptions →
...
```

And then **resource links also appear contextually everywhere else**.

On:

`/texts/kramasadbhava`

you automatically get:

```text
READ

Mahānaya translation →
Muktabodha Sanskrit →
Relevant KSTS scan →

STUDY

Sanderson article →
Dyczkowski lecture →

RELATED RESOURCES

Mahānaya →
Centre for Kaula Studies →
```

That's much better than maintaining a giant static Resources page.

### The particularly valuable starting set

If I were seeding the database today, these are the first external sources I'd ingest/index deeply:

**Muktabodha · GRETIL · Viśvāsa · SanskritDocuments · IFP · OCHS Manuscripts · NGMPP · Kaula Studies · Mahānaya · Sanskrit-Trika-Śaivism · ShivaShakti · Ambā · Anuttara Trika Kula/Dyczkowski · Lakshmanjoo Academy · Wisdomlib · SARIT · Internet Archive/KSTS · EFEO/IFP publications · Sanderson's archive · Academia/individual scholar pages · INDOLOGY.**

That's already an extraordinary federation. The thing nobody has really done is **join them at the text level**:

> `Tantrasadbhāva` → manuscripts here → Sanskrit here → partial translation here → Bang dissertation here → Sanderson mentions here → Dyczkowski discusses here → our working translation here.

That's the real hub.
